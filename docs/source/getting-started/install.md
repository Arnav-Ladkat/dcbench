============================

This page describes how to install the dcbench Python package.
 
## Install with pip 
```bash
pip install dcbench
```
> Optional: some parts of Meerkat rely on optional dependencies. If you know which optional dependencies you'd like to install, you can do so using something like `pip install dcbench[dev]` instead. See setup.py for a full list of optional dependencies.

### Install from dev
To install from a specific branch you can use the command below, replacing `main` with the name of [any branch in the dcbench repository](https://github.com/data-centric-ai/dcbench/branches).
```
pip install "dcbench @ git+https://github.com/data-centric-ai/dcbench@main"
```
